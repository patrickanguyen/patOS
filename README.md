## Building and Running from Source
At the moment, <b>patOS</b> is built using a <b>GCC cross-complier</b> as described at [OSDev.org GCC Cross-Complier](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) 
page. After creating a <b>GCC cross-complier</b>, change the path for the complier and linker in the Makefile, then use `make` to build all the files.

After building all the files, you can use then `make run` to emulate <b>patOS</b> by using <b>QEMU</b>, a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

If ever needed, all the object files can be cleaned up using the `make clean` command.
